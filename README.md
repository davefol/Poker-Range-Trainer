## Current Features
- Custom range editor.
- Required fold equity questions.
- Binary range questions.

## Planned features
- Spaced repetition instead of uniform random questions.
- More question types, based around critical no limit hold em situations such as "should I steal" , "what should my bet sizing be", and "should I c-bet". 
- Dynamic villain generator: creating realistic conselation of villain statistics such as VPIP, Fold to C-Bet, and so on. These would be slotted into questions to train adjustments to a wide variety of play type. 
- Combo tester.
